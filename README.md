 ## Dynamic Network of United States Air Transportation at Multiple Levels


**Abstract** United States air transportation contributes to the economy of the country by facilitating the mobility of people and goods. Air transportation is one of the essential systems in the US and the world. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of US air transportation from three angles (i.e., number of flights, number of passengers, and the amount of freight carried) at three levels of airport, city, and state. While there are unique dynamics at each, there is a strong fluctuation in the activity of the links, indicating a highly dynamic system. Backbone analyses of the networks also show that there are specific periods (such as 2007 for flights, 2008 for freight, and 2012 for passengers) in which network changes drastically.

**Dataset description**

Data contains networks for 10 years, in format compatible with Gephi.

There exist 9 different network representation:
Node: Airport,  Edge: Number of passengers
Node: Airport,  Edge: Number of flight
Node: Airport,  Edge: Amount of freight
Node: City,  Edge: Number of passengers
Node: City,  Edge: Number of flight
Node: City,  Edge: Amount of freight
Node: State,  Edge: Number of passengers
Node: State,  Edge: Number of flight
Node: State,  Edge: Amount of freight


Airport_Flight_E.csv -> Airport level edge file in which edge weight is in terms of number of flights.

Airport_N.csv        -> Airport level node file.
