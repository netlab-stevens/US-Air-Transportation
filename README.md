 ## Dynamic Network of United States Air Transportation at Multiple Levels


Abstract. United States air transportation contributes to the economy
of the country by facilitating the mobility of people and goods. Air transportation is one of the essential systems in the US and the world. In this
study, we investigate the dynamics of US air transportation from three
angles (i.e., number of flights, number of passengers, and the amount
of freight carried) at three levels of airport, city, and state. While there
are unique dynamics at each, there is a strong fluctuation in the activity of the links, indicating a highly dynamic system. Backbone analyses
of the networks also show that there are specific periods (such as 2007
for flights, 2008 for freight, and 2012 for passengers) in which network
changes drastically.
